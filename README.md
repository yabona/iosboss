# iosboss

config generator for Cisco IOS routers and switches...

requires python 3.6+

iosboss.py will generate the config file, the others are there as a lazy way to easily get config data into a script...

To customize the output, modify the variables in the various config files 

This script should be used for absolutely no reason and will not be maintained or thought of by any of its creators. This is legally abandonware and no person shall attempt to un-abandon it.
